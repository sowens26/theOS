This project attempts to build the basic framework to boot a C based kernel in an x86 Assembly environment.

os-image is a prebuilt image of the current release

all assembly function files are contained within the funcs directory

all C code is contained within clib

boots.asm is the core of the bootloader 

kernel-boots.asm is a simple linking file to connect the kernel and bootloader

build_script.sh may or may not work on your system with some modification it is my local build file. I've included it simply to show the process of compilation and building.

as of now most documentation is contained within code files.
